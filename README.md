# Welcome to Md Shaad Mahmud's Research Website

## About Me
I am an Associate Professor at the University of New Hampshire, specializing in wearable health technology, edge machine learning, and advanced sensor development. My research is dedicated to addressing critical health and environmental challenges by designing innovative solutions that combine cutting-edge technology with practical applications.

## Research Focus
- **Wearable Sensors**: Development of unobtrusive, smart textile sensors for health monitoring, focusing on lymphedema detection and other conditions.
- **Edge Machine Learning**: Implementation of real-time health monitoring systems using low-power, edge-based computational techniques.
- **Environmental Sensing**: Advancements in deep soil carbon and nitrogen sensing to support agricultural and environmental studies.
- **Opioid Detection**: Electrochemical sensor arrays for rapid and non-invasive opioid intake detection.

## Current Projects
1. **Smart Textile Sensors Using Bioimpedance Spectroscopy**  
   - Focus: Early detection of lymphedema using wearable technology.
   - Collaborators: Dr. Hua Fang, computational statistics expert.
   - Funding: National Science Foundation (NSF).

2. **Integrated Wearable Electrochemical Sensor Array**  
   - Focus: Rapid opioid detection through human sweat.
   - Funding: NH Bio-Made Seed Funding.

3. **Novel Frost Sensing Systems for Ecosystem Monitoring**  
   - Focus: Developing frost sensors to track freeze-thaw cycles and their environmental impact.
   - Funding: USDA Hatch Award.
